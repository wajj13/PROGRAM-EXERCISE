The threat landscape is evolving at breakneck speed and corporate cyberattack surfaces expand, with many trends and developments kicked into overdrive as a result of the surge in digital transformation investments during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

But the growth of the attack surface often results in a gap between attackers and defenders – across skills, capabilities and resources.

Managed detection and response (MDR) combines all this. But not all solutions are created equal, so let’s take a look at why your organization may need MDR, and five key things to look for in a service offering.
